# Setup
This repository houses resources required for setting up Otterize in your infrastructure, such as CloudFormation templates.

Currently, this only houses the CloudFormation template for setting up AWS IAM support for Otterize. This CloudFormation template creates AWS IAM roles and policies to allow AWS IRSA to function for a specific cluster.
